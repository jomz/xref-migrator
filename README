# Non-Crossref DOI to Crossref migration helper

This script could help you if you need to re-register DOIs for a journal that
you took over under a new DOI prefix. In our case, the existing DOI metadata
were registered partly in Crossref and in mEDRA.

PROVIDED 'AS IS', USE AT YOUR OWN RISK YADA YADA

Authored by Benny Degezelle for the publisher Universa Press and
for the journal Tijdschrift voor Geneeskunde.

## Usage:

1. Place (a) CSV file(s) with pairs of doi,new_target_url inside the 'input' dir.
2. Run `bundle install` to make sure all dependencies are met.
3. Run `ruby xref-migrator.rb` and wait for it to finish.
4. Find one XML file per journal issue in the 'output' directory.
These should be good to upload to the Crossref Administration Console.

If any of the provided DOI could not be found on Crossref nor mEDRA,
a file failed_doi.txt will also be created in the output directory.

Finally, a file transfer_list.tsv will also be generated in the output dir.
This is requested by CNRI to set up the redirects from the old to the new DOIs.
Send this to member@crossref.org or whoever follows up on the transfer at crossref. 

In our case, the metadata registered by the previous publisher was rather minimal.
Hence the re-building of the metadata, too, is rather simple.
Do have a look at the code and/or the output files to make sure that the copied
metadata are complete!

If not, welp ... at least you have a good starting point to expand on.
Please send pull requests if any modifications you make seem useful to others!

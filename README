# Non-Crossref DOI to Crossref migration helper

This script could help you if you need to re-register DOIs for a journal that
you took over under a new DOI prefix. In our case, the existing DOI metadata
were registered partly in Crossref and in mEDRA.

Expected input is (a) CSV file(s) with pairs of doi,new_target_url.
The script will then look up the existing metadata, and prepare one XML file
per journal issue in the output directory.
These can then be deposited in the Crossref Administration Console.

If any of the provided DOI could not be found on Crossref nor mEDRA,
a file failed_doi.txt will also be created in the output directory.

In our case, the metadata registered by the previous publisher was rather minimal.
Hence the re-building of the metadata, too, is rather simple.
Do have a look at the code and/or the output files to make sure that the copied
metadata are complete!

If not, welp ... at least you have a good starting point to expand on.
Please send pull requests if any modifications you make seem useful to others!
